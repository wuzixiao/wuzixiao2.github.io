Since last year July, AMLPro has been developing for 7 months, now the 1st version is nearly done and soon will be deployed for a company!

Yesterday, I read <a href="http://www.talkingquickly.co.uk/2015/04/what-id-tell-myself-about-startups/">this</a> blog. The author talked about his thought about his 5 years startups. I know that even I remember all of the content he wrote in this blog, I still will make mistakes. Anyway, making progress is a good thing.

Here is some keypoints of his thoughts that I agree.

    1. Shipping first.

The products will never be perfect enough even iphone. But people need them. So just making the key parts good enough for the product can be ship to customers. 

And many of us have heaps of ideas in the to-do list. How many of them comeout real products? We are always too rush to think carefully of the ideas, too rush to make it real. When we see a product working not as well as you thought, don't just look down on it, make a better one.

    2. Don't need to hide your ideas.

It is not a bad thing, if there are others think your idea is a nice one.
If they don't, it is not a bad thing either. Because sometimes minus people are right:)

    3. make one function perfect at least.

Windows' simple, Apple's beauty, IBM's sturdy, they make customer like them and trust them. Although many people like to pick their drawbacks. Remember "shipping first", "no ship no criticize".

    4. tech news have low return

Yes, we should not spend much time on the flowerish tech websites. There are too much info there, we have to waste out time to pick out we need. That doesn't mean we don't need to read any news. News is important, but we don't need to know them immediately, 1-2 week later is not big problem if we are not short-term trader.

    5. write blog

I will also share more on FB, Twitter. It is a connection world.
