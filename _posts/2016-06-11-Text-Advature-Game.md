Found another way to improve my English.

*Text Advanture Game*

I want to play it on my Mac. So I need a z-machine to run the game script.
There are some choises of the z-machine which is a kind of interpreter. After google, I choose spatterlight. It can interpreter z file as well.

I can use 'save' command to save a game, and 'restore' to play a game from last save point.

My next object is build a text game engineer in Haskell!
