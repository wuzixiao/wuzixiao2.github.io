Millions of pragrammers want to be freelancers. But when you really begin to seek a job on [upwork](http://upwork.com) or [elancer](http://elancer.com), you will find that it is not as easy as you think. 

Firstly, you will spent quite a lot of time searching. Then, when you find an job you're interested in, the employer may ask 3-4 questions regarding your opinion of that job, as well as your relevant experience. After you write all of them, sometimes, it feel that finish a funciton of your code. 

Secondly, some employer's requirement is not very clear. It is OK if they want to use Agile method, but sometimes, they are not. I think they just have an idea and want to find someone make it real and they can make money with it. These employers usually want to find the cheapest applications.

If you are an employer, and you really need someone to help you write an programme. After you post your job description on the platform, about 20 applications will be received. After you spend one whole day to check through them, and reply to some of them. But they don't reply, like disapearing.

If I design and operate a freelancer platform. I will do:

* Test freelancer with one or two projects, but not for free. Actually, my platform could be a certain kind of outsourcing company, so these projects can be used by some other companies. In this way, the ability of the freelancer can be estimated more accurate.

* Freelancers don't need to spend too much time on job-seeking. They can apply jobs similar with the projects they have done before. 

* The platform will check job description manually, and set a proper salary range. Then the job will send directly to the availabe and proper freelancers.
