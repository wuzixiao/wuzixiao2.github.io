It is a book written by Viktor E. Frankl who was a docter and survived through concentration camps. He said there are three possible sources for meaning: in work, in love and in courage during diffcult times. Forces beyong your control can take away everything you ossess except one thing, your freedom to choose how you will respond to the situation. 

It is true that only a few people are capable of reaching such high moral standards. But there are indeed some people have done that. 

How to do that? It is not an ability, it is about attitude. It is like the more a man tries to demonstrate his sexual potency or a woman her ability to experience orgasm, the less they are about to succeed. It must be kept in mind that, optimism is not anything to be commanded or ordered. One cannot even force oneself to be optimistic indiscriminately, against all odds, against all hope. 

The auther gave us the answer in the last sentance : The meaning of your life is to help others find the meaning of theirs.
