I first install Emacs on my compuater was in 2003, it is already 13 years ago. It is my first computer bought by my parents in my third grade of the University. I tried to install Linux(red hat), Emacs, Asm IDE, and maybe some other 'advanced' software on that, but none of them I digged too much.In the end I just chose the easy way. But easy way is better?

Last year I tried to use Emacs, but I also didn't insist. At that time I wanted to learn functional language actually and Emacs could use eLisp to extend. But before I use eList I had to overcome the complex command that are easier on Vim. In the end, of course I droped again.

But why this time I successed? I think finally I could realise the good part of Emacs. It could make me  concertrade on writting not just changing the position of the cursor. Even I could use evil-mode on Emacs but I don't want to use now.

But this time, only one week, even my daily work is quite busy, I reinstall emacs on my Mac and my working computer, and start to use it. I think one of the reason is org-mode. And another is I realise hard way has its benefit. The design of emacs is beautiful as well, just think which software could last for more than 30 years and cannot be replaced. I think it is the most important reason I can insist this time.

This week I config my Haskell dev env on emamcs.
