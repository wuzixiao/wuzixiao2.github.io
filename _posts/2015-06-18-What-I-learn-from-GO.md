From the first day of this year 2015, I joined a local meetup, playing [go]() every Monday everning. Since then, I am into it, and keep learning and practising it. Last month, I got the 1st place in the NZ GO Open Tournement in the non-professional group. It is really a great encouragement to me. I will insist to play with it and hope one day, I can get the level to play evenly with some professional players. I believe I will get more fun during this process.

###Result is not the very important
When you look at some game records, one by one, from professionals to beginners, most of them look very similar. I bet you can tell whether one record was played by professionals or by beginners. But If you could know how every store was putted on the board, you would figout out where isthis record from. This is different from software, at least users know if one product works well. Figuring out the best move based on the present situation is the key to win.

###Big picture
Sometimes, you need inflence to fight. Sometimes you need territory. The direction to play is every important. How to find out the right direction to play, we need a big picture. Which place is the largest one on the board? Which move is the key point for both of players. 

###Some moves have bad impact to yourself.
If you are not careful, some move will kill yourself. So it is not that we can get better result by giving more resources to it. Giving proper resource at the proper time is the key.

###Ability Vigour Luck
Master Wu, who is the most great Go play ever said :" Winning a game needs ability, vigour and lucy." Life is same as well. Keep learning and practising to gain ability. Do not lose your confidence ever. And the last, remember 'luck will not always fall on your head':)
