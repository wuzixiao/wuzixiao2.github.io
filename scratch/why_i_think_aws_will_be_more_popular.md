## Why I think AWS will be more popular

AWS is Amazon's cloud computer platform. It derived from Amazon's inter development team. As more and more products developed by amazon, they found that there are some common features 
 
###think about how people operator a computer when it was builded 50 years ago.

At that time, 

###think about how people write programme 20 years ago

### think about how many different tech stacks you will learn to fit into this IT world.

###think about security issues all around

### will JVM be faster than C++? 
In the current computer artitechture struct, I have to say it is impossible if we purely compare a piece of code, as C++ make better use of CPU cache than JVM. 

But considering a large application development, debug and code refactoring are both big issues. Java or JVM laugnage will be more suitable for that. 

AWS has the same priciple of JVM. If we just develop a small application, and don't need to do a lot of server management work, we can build up a server by ourself. But If we want our application to be more scaleable and secure, AWS is better of course.
