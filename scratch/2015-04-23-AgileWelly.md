# A day of AgileWelly Open Space
=====

Today, I joined a meetup at MacBrewery near the waterfront and Te Papa. There are about 100 people attended this meetup. 
At the beginning, a agile coach explain  what open space is. It is like a self orgainizing event. Some people who have a topic need to write down their topic and the start time on a piece of paper. Then they pin the topic paper on a black board.

All the people can choose the topic they have passion about. At the topic group start time, people are divided into small groups and begin to discuss. 

During the discussing, host stands in front of a board, hosts the meeting, and records the key note according to conversation. At the end of discussion , about 45 mins later, host need to give a brief summary of the conversation.

Today, I intended five topic groups. 
1. How to build the right thing for business value?
2. What is like if pair programming consist a developer and a non-developer?
3. technology to use for a self-organization group.
4. self-choosing groups
5. How to sell continual dilivery?
